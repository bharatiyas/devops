To check if vagrant is installed and its version
$ vagrant -v

To list Vargrant boxes
$ vagrant box list


To download an image from vagrant cloud. But it won't install the box. It will just put that box on your machine.
$ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64

To create the vagrant file for a particular image
$ vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64

To create a default vagrant file
$ vagrant init

To start a Vargrant box (it uses a .vagrant file). Go to the directory where the .vagrant file is there
It will import the image (if already imported checks for updates), will boot-up the Linux VM, add a vagrant user and create ssh privileges for that 
user so that you do not need a password.
$ vagrant up

To ssh into a vagrant box go to the directory where your vagrant box is located then type. It will ssh as vagrant user.
$ vagrant ssh

If you are running multiple VMs then you need to mention the VM name
$ vagrant ssh <machine1>

Whenever you sping up a box its always a good idea to update the VM
$ sudo apy-get update

You can execute any command on the command prompt as you would normally to on any Linux box. Like
$ sudo apt-get install nginx

To reload the configuration from the vagrant file. It will reboot the VM.
$ vagrant reload

To stop and delete all traces of the vagrant machine. use -f option to do it forcefully
$ vagrant destroy

To see status of a virtual machine
$ vagrant status <VM_name>

To shut down a VM forcefully
$ vagrant halt

To simply suspend the virtual machine
$ vagrant suspend 

In either of the above cases, to restart it again, simply run `vagrant up`.
